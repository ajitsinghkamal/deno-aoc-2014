**Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?**

| Left | Right |
| ---- | ----- |
| 3 | 4 |
| 4 | 3 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 3 | 9 |
| 3 | 3 |

> To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is `2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5`, a total distance of `11`!
